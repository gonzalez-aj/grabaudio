## Code Snippet
To access the Firestore Cloud Storage:
```
const storage = firebase.storage();
```
To delete all of a Song's Snippets associated with the Song, while deleting the song too:
```
const deleteSongSnippets = (songId) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  getSnippetsBySong(songId).then((snippetsArray) => {
    const deleteSnippetPromises = snippetsArray.map((snippet) => deleteSingleSnippet(snippet.firebaseKey));

    Promise.all(deleteSnippetPromises).then(() => {
      deleteSingleSong(songId).then(resolve);
    });
  }).catch((error) => reject(error));
});
```
